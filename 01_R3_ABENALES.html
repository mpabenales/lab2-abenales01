	<h2>First Web App on Heroku and Github</h2>
	I had a hard time coping up with the activity since I am absent the day that it is discussed. So I tried to make it by myself, get some tutorials online and the guideline from Ms. Jen and Ding. So when I'm able to do it alone. I find it satisfying. Tho I had a hard time using Github since I don't have any background in that web app. When Ms. Jen looked for it, I ask Rommel to help me with deploying my web app on Github. Gladly, I made it on time. I made a simple web app wherein the Activity 1 is being the content.
