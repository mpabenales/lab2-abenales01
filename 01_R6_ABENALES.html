	USERDES class is one of my favorite even if I’m having some hard time coping up with the activities. I find USERDES class as relaxing and flexible especially when it comes to thinking about how you will personally design some things.<br>
	The challenges that I encounter was making it up to my group mates since I was too busy with my organization’s work for the past months. I felt ashamed for not being there for my group mates but I still make sure that I’m able to do my best to do my part on the group. I also encountered passing my reflections and activities late because of the same reason with my group mates. I easily get sick during the first half of the term because of my tiring schedule (I have classes from Monday to Saturday) and my travelling system since I’m from Cavite and I need to commute because I don’t have enough funds to rent a dorm.<br>
	My expectation for finals is to be as light as how the class has been through for the past half of the term.<br>
	I guess, there’s nothing to improve. Just stay balancing the light and understanding mood with some restrictions. <br>
